# Othello Game

Letter Grade: A

The goal of this project was to create a Computer Player for the game Othello who's goal was to achieve victory by the smallest margin (one disk).

Effectively, the intent was to have the Computer Player toy with its opponent, creating the illusion of a close game but always winning.

Towards this goal, the Computer Player in testing only achieved its goal 1% of the time.

Looking at the test data, I determined winning by any odd number was rare, having occurred only 6% of the time. Looking at wins by two disks (the lowest even number), the success rate of the Computer Player increased to 25%.
